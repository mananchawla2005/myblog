# Hey folks, 
## Welcome to my first dev blog made in Vuepress

## Introduction:
- ### Vuepress is a nice static side generator to build and make really awesome documentation and personal blogs
- ### Also, it offers many official and community made plugins which make your work more easier.
- ### Vuepress by itself comes with a default theme but you can customise it as well or download one from the community.

## Contribution:
- ### If anyone wanna contribute to my little dev blog project, he/she is welcome to do so anytime.
- ### Steps for contribution:
- #### Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/mananchawla2005/myblog.git`.
- #### Change the directory to myblog with `cd myblog`.
- #### `npm install` to install all the dependencies including vuepress.
- #### Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.
## Happy Hacking!!
